TEXT_TO_SUMMARIZE = '''
In this notebook we will be using the transformer model, first introduced in this paper. Specifically, we will be using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from this paper.
Transformer models are considerably larger than anything else covered in these tutorials. As such we are going to use the transformers library to get pre-trained transformers and use them as our embedding layers. We will freeze (not train) the transformer and only train the remainder of the model which learns from the representations produced by the transformer. In this case we will be using a multi-layer bi-directional GRU, however any model can learn from these representations.
